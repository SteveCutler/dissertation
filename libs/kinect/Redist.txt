Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) Redistributable Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redistributable Code is identified as the file in the Redist subdirectory of the SDK install directory:

   Redist\KinectRuntime-v1.7-Setup.exe


That file is a setup executable file which will include all needed components including Kinect for Windows 1.7 Runtime and Drivers(The drivers are not updated for 1.7 in Device Manager), Microsoft Speech runtime components, C++ runtime components, and also includes the .NET 4.0 install executable which will download and install .NET 4.0 if neither .NET 4.0 nor .NET 4.5 is already present on the computer.  Developers should include the Redistributable Code with their applications as part of a chain install with their own application setup.
